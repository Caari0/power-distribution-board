I have designed a PCB for use in RC airplane interior avionics. This card is supposed to; 

Get power from external LiPo battery, 
Transmit power to sensors, 
Transmit power to communication modules, 
Stabilize the voltage from the battery, 
Reducing the voltage coming from the battery according to the modules 


Required Components; 

Voltage Regulators : 
Lm2596,  
Tps54531,  
Tps54308,  
MT3608, 
XL4015e1, 
AMS1117 


Order Your PCB From JLCPCB 
For that, you just have to go to JLCPCB, (https://jlcpcb.com/HAR/) and click on the “QUOTE NOW” button. JLCPCB (ShenzhenJLC Electronics Co., Ltd.), is the largest PCB prototype enterprise in China and a high-tech manufacturer specializing in quick PCB prototype and small-batch PCB production. 

You can order a minimum of 5 PCBs for just $2. To get the PCB manufactured, upload the Gerber file you downloaded in the last step. Upload the.zip file or you can also drag and drop the Gerber files. After uploading the zip file, you’ll see a success message at the bottom of the file that is successfully uploaded. 

You can review the PCB in the Gerber viewer to make sure everything is good. You can view both the top and bottom of the PCB. After making sure our PCB looks good, we can now place the order at a reasonable price. You can order 5 PCBs for just $2 but if it’s your first order then you can get 10 PCBs for $2. To place the order, click on the “SAVE TO CART” button.
